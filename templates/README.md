a simple go script to generate and templates file to visualize the color palette

## usage

```bash
go run gen-html.go -css <path to css file> -output my_color_display.html
```

NOTE: it doesn't matter how many colors the css pallete has, it will generate a html file regardless

NOTE: I'll built it into the main project soon!
